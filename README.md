## Tree-guided convex clustering simulation source code

We share the code to ensure that our results in the paper **Tree-Guided** $L_1$-Convex Clustering can be independently verified and validated. The simulation code includes all essential scripts required to reproduce the key experiments and figures presented in the paper. Please note that users will need to install several R packages and download publicly available datasets separately, as these are not included in the repository

We welcome feedback and potential collaboration opportunities. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!
